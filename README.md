## Nonfunctional requirements 
The two programming paths that I considered were using our MEVN application as a boilerplate (Mongo, Express, Vue, and Node), or writing a new mobile app from scratch using HTML5 with Mongo or another database.

- Skills - MEVN -- Since we have used this more recently, and my last HTML5 app was written years ago
- Features - MEVN -- Much more functionality than simple HTML5
- Constraints - MEVN -- HTML5 can be limited in some applications, especially when doing more advanced applications
- Usability - same -- Both can be written for easy usability
- Support - HTML5 -- Both have lots of support, but HTML5 has more users worldwide
- Security - same -- Both can be written for security, mainly by encrypting the database and placing app on a secure server
- Complexity - HTML5 -- Much easier to use than MEVN

- Overall - MEVN is the winner, especially since I am more fresh with this technology

## Installation instructions

## Architecture discussion 

For this rudimentary application, we simply need a login page with no scroll bar (to keep it on a single page for tablets) and a database backend.  The redirect function should go back to the login screen once a user has "signed in".  Perhaps a pop-up box should display to verify that the user was logged.  The admin feature will allow a privileged user to access the database entries for auditing.

## Plan of action
- [ ] Create main page
- [ ] blah
- [ ] Create database
- [ ] Hook up database
